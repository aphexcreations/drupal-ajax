Drupal AJAX Forms

In a nutshell, this module will "Ajaxify" almost any Drupal form, including
the user login form. It will essentially allow you to validate, preview, and
save your forms without a page refresh.

By default in Drupal, when a form is submitted, the values of that form are
sent through a series of Drupal validation procedures. When these validations
are completed the validation messages are normally sent back to the user with
a standard page refresh.

For example, if a user fills out a form which requires a first name, but the
user leaves these fields blank, they will be presented with a message that
says "First Name is Required".

This module allows the validation messages to be sent back to the user without
a page refresh, so they appear in realtime. This makes for a more streamlined
user experience. If the submitted form has no errors, the page will be
redirected to the appropriate submission landing page.

Configuration is easy. Simply go to "admin/settings/ajax" and select the
forms for which you want to use AJAX handling.

To test the module, go to one of the forms which you selected. For example if
you selected "Content Type Blog", then go to "node/add/blog". Then fill out
the form, intentionally inputting invalid data or leave a required field
blank. Submit the form. You should then see the validation messages appear at
the top of the form near-instantaniously.

This module will work out of the box with forms displayed in a Thickbox.
However, it will only work out of the box with the "AJAX Content" Thickbox,
NOT the "iFramed Content" Thickbox.

This module will work with the Captcha module (6.x-1.0-rc2), but you must first
apply a set of patches to the captcha module which are provided in the
"patches/captcha" directory.

Support for Drupal 5.x has been discontinued.
